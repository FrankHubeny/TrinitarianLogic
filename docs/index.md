This site contains the project documentation for the
`altrea` python project designed to explore Alternative Reasonings.
It begings with a description of classical truth function and
first order with absolute identity logics.  It next considers
baed on that foundations alternatives to this classical reasoning.
The alternatives include modal logics, quantum logics,
intuitionist mathematical logics and relative identity logics.
A framework for exploring other logics is provided as well.

## Table Of Contents

The documentation follows the best practice for
project documentation as described by Daniele Procida
in the [Di√°taxis documentation framework](https://diataxis.fr/)
and consists of four separate parts:

1. [Tutorials](tutorials.md)
2. [How-To Guides](how-to-guide.md)
3. [Reference](reference.md)
4. [Explanation](explanation.md)

Quickly find what you're looking for depending on
your use case by looking at the different pages.
