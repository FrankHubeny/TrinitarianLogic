	abstract = {Thomas Forsyth Torrance  (30 August 1913 – 2 December 2007), commonly referred to as T. F. Torrance, was a Scottish Protestant theologian and minister. Torrance served for 27 years as professor of Christian dogmatics at New College, in the University of Edinburgh. He is best known for his pioneering work in the study of science and theology, but he is equally respected for his work in systematic theology. While he wrote many books and articles advancing his own study of theology, he also edited the translation of several hundred theological writings into English from other languages, including the English translation of the thirteen-volume, six-million-word Church Dogmatics of Swiss theologian Karl Barth, as well as John Calvin's New Testament Commentaries. He was a member of the famed Torrance family of theologians.
Torrance has been acknowledged as one of the most significant English-speaking theologians of the 20th century. In 1978, he received the Templeton Foundation Prize for Progress in Religion. Torrance remained a dedicated churchman throughout his life, serving as an ordained minister in the Church of Scotland. He was instrumental in the development of the historic agreement between the Reformed and Eastern Orthodox churches on the doctrine of the Trinity when a joint statement of agreement on that doctrine was issued between the World Alliance of Reformed Churches and the Orthodox Church on 13 March 1991. He retired from the University of Edinburgh in 1979, but continued to lecture and to publish extensively. Several influential books on the Trinity were published after his retirement; The Trinitarian Faith: The Evangelical Theology of the Ancient Catholic Church (1988), Trinitarian Perspectives: Toward Doctrinal Agreement (1994) and The Christian Doctrine of God, One Being Three Persons (1996).},

	abstract = {The Christian doctrine of the Trinity (Latin: Trinitas, lit. 'triad', from Latin: trinus 'threefold') is the central dogma concerning the nature of God in most Christian churches, which defines one God existing in three coequal, coeternal, consubstantial divine persons: God the Father, God the Son (Jesus Christ) and God the Holy Spirit, three distinct persons sharing one homoousion (essence) "each is God, complete and whole." As the Fourth Lateran Council declared, it is the Father who begets, the Son who is begotten, and the Holy Spirit who proceeds. In this context, the three persons define who God is, while the one essence defines what God is. This expresses at once their distinction and their indissoluble unity. Thus, the entire process of creation and grace is viewed as a single shared action of the three divine persons, in which each person manifests the attributes unique to them in the Trinity, thereby proving that everything comes "from the Father," "through the Son," and "in the Holy Spirit."This doctrine is called Trinitarianism and its adherents are called Trinitarians, while its opponents are called antitrinitarians or nontrinitarians. Christian nontrinitarian positions include Unitarianism, Binitarianism and Modalism.
While the developed doctrine of the Trinity is not explicit in the books that constitute the New Testament, the New Testament possesses a triadic understanding of God and contains a number of Trinitarian formulas. The doctrine of the Trinity was first formulated among the early Christians and fathers of the Church as they attempted to understand the relationship between Jesus and God in their scriptural documents and prior traditions.Though the Trinity is mainly a Christian concept, Judaism has had parallel views, especially among writings from the kabbalah tradition.},

	abstract = {Identity is often said to be a relation each thing bears to itself andto no other thing (e.g., Zalabardo 2000). This characterization isclearly circular (“no other thing”) andparadoxical too, unless the notion of “each thing” isqualified. More satisfactory (though partial) characterizations areavailable and the idea that such a relation of absolute identityexists is commonplace. Some, however, deny that a relation of absoluteidentity exists. Identity, they say, is relative: It is possible forobjects xxx and yyy to be the same FFF and yet not thesame GGG (where FFF and GGG are predicates representing kinds ofthings—apples, ships, passengers—rather than merelyproperties of things—colors, shapes). In such a case“same” cannot mean absolute identity. For example, thesame person might be two different passengers, since one person may becounted twice as a passenger. If to say that xxx and yyy are thesame person is to say that xxx and yyy are persons and are(absolutely) identical, and to say that xxx and yyy are differentpassengers is to say that xxx and yyy are passengers and are(absolutely) distinct, we have a contradiction. Others maintain thatwhile there are such cases of “relative identity”, thereis also such a thing as absolute identity. According to this view,identity comes in two forms: trivial or absolute and nontrivial orrelative (Gupta 1980). These maverick views present a seriouschallenge to the received, absolutist doctrine of identity. In thefirst place, cases such as the passenger/person case are moredifficult to dismiss than might be supposed (but see below, §3).Secondly, the standard view of identity is troubled by many persistentpuzzles and problems, some of recent and some of ancient origin. Therelative identity alternative sheds considerable light on theseproblems even if it does not promise a resolution of them all.},

I maintain that the justification for this response to the problem of evil does not depend on the availability of a persuasive argument for the existence of God. I will focus on one category of animal suffering: the gratuitous suffering of unseen animals. For reasons that will become clear, I think that this category of evil is the most difficult for the rational theist to explain.

	abstract = {We present a new understanding of Christ’s real presence in the Eucharist on the model of Stump’s account of God’s omnipresence and Green and Quan’s account of experiencing God in Scripture. On this understanding, Christ is derivatively, rather than fundamentally, located in the consecrated bread and wine, such that Christ is present to the believer through the consecrated bread and wine, thereby making available to the believer a second-person experience of Christ, where the consecrated bread and wine are the way in which she shares attention with him. The consecrated bread and wine are then, in a sense, icons of Christ.},
